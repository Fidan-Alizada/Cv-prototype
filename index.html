        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>At the moment, I have recently completed my final year of study at the Azerbaijan State Economic University. During my time at the university, I delved into various complex economic topics, honing my numeric, boolean, and analytical skills necessary to address the demands of the economy.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to my academic studies, I am proficient in several languages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>English</li>
            <li>Azerbaijani</li>
            <li>Russian</li>
            <li>Turkish</li>
            <li>French</li>
            <li>Italian</li>
        </ul>
     
        <p>I have also been actively expanding my skill set by attending courses in web development. I have completed courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, learning how to build interactive and responsive web applications. Furthermore, I have also ventured into server-side development with Node.js, enabling me to create dynamic and scalable web applications.</p>
        
        <p>Moreover, I have explored the world of front-end frameworks by taking courses in React. Learning React has empowered me to build modern and efficient user interfaces, enhancing the user experience of web applications.</p>
    
        <p>I am confident that my academic background, programming skills, proficiency in languages, and ongoing education in web development have equipped me with the knowledge and abilities to contribute effectively to an entrepreneurial culture. I am eager to apply my skills, engage in discussions, exchange ideas, and network with individuals who share a similar vision for innovation and growth.</p>
        
        <p>Aside from my academic pursuits, programming endeavors, language proficiency, and courses, I have also gained practical experience through internships and work experiences, such as my role as a Customer relations manager at EPOINT "Global Innovations LLC" and internships at RabitəBank. These experiences have further enriched my understanding of the business world and enhanced my interpersonal and problem-solving skills.</p>
    
        <p>I am passionate about continuous learning and personal development, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute positively to dynamic and forward-thinking environments.</p>
